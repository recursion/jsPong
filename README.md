# jsPong: 
### A simple javascript implementation of the classic game pong

##### What works
* game loads and performs a proper game loop
* paddle controllers work
* basic boundry detection
* basic score system
* the ball! :)
* some basic paddle/ball velocity math seems to be working ok

##### TODO
* add a pause/unpause
* keep score of overall games vs. players?
* let the ball go all the way off the screen (when scoring a goal) before resetting.
* flare? :P

##### DONE
* Add a ball - Hahaha!
* test git again.
